# team-profile-generator

**Team Profile Generator**

Collects information from user regarding details for the team. There is a prompt for one manager and unlimited interns and engineers. Once the data is complete, the user can exit the prompts and an employee directory is generated in html. The html page will show the information for each employee.

**Installation**
Download index.js and the accompanying module folders. Run "node index" from the terminal to begin.

**Usage**
Run "node index" from the terminal to begin the employee directory. If testing, type "npm test".

**Contributions**
There is opportunity to design the html in a more compact way, and to modify team members, including addition and deletion of current team members.

**Acknowledgments**
Special thanks to my tutor Rhys and my TA Matt for helping me understand the complex concepts in this assignment.

**Tests**
Type "npm jest" from the terminal, all should pass
